## Method 1: USB Cable by Prolific
 
This method requires a USB cable by Prolific that connects the Sokkia Set 510 Total Station to the computer. You also need to install the drivers for the cable from [this link](http://www.prolific.com.tw/eng/downloads.asp?ID=30). Note that this method only works for Windows XP 32-bit systems. For Windows XP 64-bit or Windows Vista/7 systems, you need to use another method.
 
1. Connect the USB cable to the Sokkia Set 510 Total Station and the computer.
2. Turn on the Sokkia Set 510 Total Station and press the MENU key.
3. Select COMMS SETUP and press ENTER.
4. Select I/O PORT and press ENTER.
5. Select USB and press ENTER.
6. Press ESC twice to exit the menu.

## Method 2: Serial D9 Cable
 
This method requires a serial D9 cable that connects the Sokkia Set 510 Total Station to the computer. You also need to configure the serial port settings on both devices. This method works for any Windows system that has a serial D9 port. If your computer does not have a serial D9 port, you can use an adapter such as the StarTech PCI RS232 Serial Adapter Card or the Tripplite Keyspan 19HS RS232 to USB Adapter. These adapters also require driver installation that can be found on their websites.
