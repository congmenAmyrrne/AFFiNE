One of the highlights of the movie is the chemistry between Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Pankaj Tripathi, who share a brief but memorable scene together. The two actors are known for their versatility and talent, and they deliver a captivating performance in this movie. Nawazuddin Siddiqui is brilliant as Anwar, a man who is torn between his past and present, his dreams and reality, his love and loneliness. He portrays Anwar's vulnerability, humour, and courage with finesse. Pankaj Tripathi is equally impressive as Amol, a man who has left behind his family and village for a new life in the city. He conveys Amol's guilt, regret, and hope with subtlety.

It is a movie that showcases the artistry of Buddhadeb Dasgupta and the brilliance of Nawazuddin Siddiqui.
