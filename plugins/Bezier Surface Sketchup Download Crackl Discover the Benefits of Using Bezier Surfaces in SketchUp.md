# How to Download and Install Bezier Surface Plugin for SketchUp
 
Bezier Surface is a plugin for SketchUp that allows you to create smooth and organic surfaces using bezier curves. It is developed by ThomThom and requires TT\_Lib2 library to work. You can download both plugins for free from SketchUcation PluginStore[^1^] [^2^]. Here are the steps to install and use Bezier Surface plugin for SketchUp:
 
1. Download TT\_Lib2 and Bezier Surface plugins from SketchUcation PluginStore[^1^] [^2^]. You can either use the SketchUcation Tools extension to install them automatically, or download the RBZ files and install them manually from SketchUp Preferences > Extensions > Install Extension.
2. Restart SketchUp to activate the plugins. You should see a new toolbar called Bezier Surface with four icons: Draw Bezier Patch, Edit Bezier Patch, Toggle Control Points, and Toggle Control Polygons.
3. To draw a bezier surface, click on the Draw Bezier Patch icon and start drawing a rectangular grid of control points on a plane. You can adjust the number of rows and columns of the grid by typing numbers in the VCB (Value Control Box) at the bottom right corner of SketchUp window. Press Enter when you are done.
4. You can edit the shape of the bezier surface by clicking on the Edit Bezier Patch icon and dragging the control points or control polygons. You can also use SketchUp tools like Move, Rotate, Scale, Push/Pull, etc. to modify the surface.
5. To toggle the visibility of the control points or control polygons, click on the Toggle Control Points or Toggle Control Polygons icons respectively. You can also use keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+P for control points and Ctrl+L for control polygons.
6. To convert the bezier surface to a regular SketchUp face, right-click on it and select Explode. You can then apply materials, textures, or other operations to it.

Bezier Surface plugin is a powerful and easy-to-use tool for creating organic shapes in SketchUp. However, be aware that it is not compatible with some other plugins or tools that require quad faces, such as SubD or QuadFace Tools. Also, be careful when downloading crack versions of plugins or software from untrusted sources, as they may contain viruses or malware that can harm your computer or data.

Here are some more paragraphs about Bezier Surface plugin for SketchUp:
 
Bezier Surface plugin is based on the mathematical concept of bezier curves, which are parametric curves that can be defined by a set of control points. A bezier curve can be interpolated by a polynomial function of degree n, where n is the number of control points minus one. For example, a bezier curve with four control points is a cubic polynomial function. A bezier surface is a generalization of a bezier curve to two dimensions, where a rectangular grid of control points defines a surface that can be interpolated by a bivariate polynomial function.
 
Bezier Surface plugin allows you to create and edit bezier surfaces in SketchUp with ease and flexibility. You can draw a bezier surface by specifying the number of rows and columns of the control grid, and then adjust the shape of the surface by manipulating the control points or control polygons. You can also use SketchUp tools to transform the surface in various ways. Bezier Surface plugin also supports undo and redo operations, so you can experiment with different shapes without losing your previous work.

Bezier Surface plugin is useful for creating smooth and organic shapes that are difficult or impossible to achieve with SketchUp's native tools. For example, you can create curved surfaces, domes, spheres, pillows, cushions, etc. with Bezier Surface plugin. You can also combine multiple bezier surfaces to create complex shapes, such as cars, boats, planes, animals, etc. Bezier Surface plugin is compatible with SketchUp versions from 8 to 2021, and works on both Windows and Mac platforms.
